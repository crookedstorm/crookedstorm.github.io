I’ve watched the US become a political
trash fire. Loads of things ended up far more costly than we’d hoped in our lovely
plans on paper (and almost ended up total disasters). Through the whole emotional rollercoaster
it’s been a net positive for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wonderful-things-that-happened-this-past-year&quot;&gt;Wonderful things that happened this past year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-new-job&quot;&gt;My new job!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t easy to decide to leave my role at Code School/Pluralsight as a developer and 
devops engineer.  However, how can you pass up a role with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;?!?
At least that’s how I thought of it.  It kind of fulfills a dream since I was a kid to make a living helping
to spread, preserve and expand human knowledge.  Working with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Cloud_Services_team&quot;&gt;Cloud Services Team&lt;/a&gt; is great, and I feel like
I’m really doing something Good For The World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-skoolie&quot;&gt;The Skoolie!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent nearly three years living in a 6x12 cargo trailer.  This got us by, but there’s
really no way to make 70 square feet a reasonable and “nice” place to live unless you live alone,
have endless resources or the world’s cleverest carpentry skills.  I have none of those.  While
my amazing wife was able to set things up really well, and I rigged up solar power and all the basics,
we absolutely had to do something better.  The thing is that while the worst debt was fixed
by living on the road as cheaply as humanly possible, we still weren’t in a great situation yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution was to save up money from every source I could imagine, buy an old school bus (after
loads of research on how to choose and price an old diesel) and build it into a home.  The trailer
became our daughter’s room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/thebus-before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Bus Before&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Our bus before conversion
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This went…poorly.  The money we saved was eaten by a sudden catastrophic engine problem that
would not have been foreseeable without taking it apart.  That’s fixed, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navistar_DT_engine&quot;&gt;Navistar DT466E&lt;/a&gt;
now runs like new. On the other hand, that was the build budget that paid for the repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gofundme, a lot of scraping and some side-work later, we were able to get a bunch of plywood, solar panels and
such.  Then the true hell of 2018 started for us: the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see building out a school bus into a house requires a lot fo things, often including
replacing the floor boards, removing seats, building new furniture, removing wiring
and signals that relate to the former life of the school bus, etc.  People often take years to accomplish this.
We did it in just shy of two grueling months.  I can’t say I remember all of it.  My wife worked
from sun up to sun down, and I worked on it whenever I wasn’t doing my day job. This was all under the constant threat
of a forest fire burning through with no notice because you don’t get an evacuation notice when you are a nomad in
some clearing that nobody even knows is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we moved in.  The trailer is now a wonderful bedroom for our daughter with a tool closet (and independent power
supply).  It’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/thebus-after.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Bus After&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Our skoolie after conversion!
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are still on the road, living as nomads so there’s no rent or utilities to pay, but we now live with
much greater dignity and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-new-teapot&quot;&gt;Our New Teapot!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the years we lived in a cargo trailer, it was not possible to have a decent teapot.  We had to
deal with stainless steel mugs and tea bags for our precious brew.  Well, now that my wife built a wonderful,
road-worthy pantry in the bus, we have a real, china teapot once again.  It’s just a simple, white affair, but
being able to enjoy proper tea without wasting all that tea bag paper and stuff is just great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/teapot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;our teapot&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Yay!
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

name=&quot;road&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now that was the wonderful camp.&amp;nbsp; Here is the tale of the road.&lt;br /&gt;We knew there was a long dirt road in, which is nothing new.&amp;nbsp; When entering a state forest you expect as much.&amp;nbsp; However, the road was marked &quot;minimal maintenance&quot;, so we knew it would be potentially exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undaunted, we proceeded as planned, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PLr4nzu.jpg&quot;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;This was the better part of the road.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The recent snow melt had rendered much of the road a pile of mud that my boots sank into several inches just walking on it.&amp;nbsp; Rocks tall enough to high-center a Subaru stuck out every now and then, and every now and then, there was a tree trunk to move aside, drive over or drive around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road in was quite the white-knuckle effort in our 2-wheel drive SUV that Miriam made it through with some rather impressive driving.&amp;nbsp; It was so bad that we figured we would try to find another way out of the forest the next day.&amp;nbsp; Therein lies the tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We set out before eating lunch, figuring we could take care of that on the road.&amp;nbsp; The weather was lovely, and the sun was warming the frosty landscape.&amp;nbsp; Brynhilde, our Jeep, grumbled along the bumpy dirt roads as we set our course using, alas, Google Maps Navigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google Maps apparently hadn't been informed that after Hurricane Irene, an essential bit of road that it suggested we take was closed to all motor vehicles because the Forest Rangers considered it unsafe even for off-road four wheelers and Jeep Wranglers.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, the road was also not marked as such on the end that we were coming from.&amp;nbsp; It just looked rarely-used and a bit rough when we started.&amp;nbsp; It didn't look that way after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road was so narrow that some pickups would not have been able to squeeze down it, so turning around didn't seem possible once the going got rough.&amp;nbsp; The rocks became some large and the ditches so deep that we were scraping over them by force of momentum to avoid being high-centered.&amp;nbsp; Miriam worked the low gears and timed things just right to push that 3000+ pound 2-wheel drive SUV over wet rocks, mud and creeks on a steep incline, the wheels scrabbling for puchase.&amp;nbsp; We kept going because we appeared to have no other option, and we hoped that the road would improve soon.&amp;nbsp; It didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, we got to yet another deep ravine and stopped.&amp;nbsp; Walking ahead, I saw that the next ravine ahead, which had a lovely stream that turned into a waterfall rolling through it, was clearly too deep for Brynhilde to manage, even with Miriam's expert handling.&amp;nbsp; We couldn't back down the hill without losing our rear end.&amp;nbsp; We were stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the first thing we did was take stock of our situation.&amp;nbsp; We were stuck in a state forest with a full complement of camping gear, running water nearby and plenty of day light.&amp;nbsp; That's not too bad.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, we had no cell phone signal, we figured we'd be lucky if the car has no damage at this point, and the only dwelling we'd passed in miles was abandoned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to follow the road on foot up the hill to get cell signal and figure out how to rescue our car.&amp;nbsp; That told us a few things.&amp;nbsp; First, there is no way we could have driven up the rest of the hill even if we could fill in that trough with rocks to drive over simply because the mud was too deep and filled with rocks on too steep a slope.&amp;nbsp; It also told us that we had made it within a half mile of a well-maintained gravel road with good cell signal.&amp;nbsp; But now, who do we call?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that if you call the NY State Forest Rangers, they will save you if you are stranded, but they will only save &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The car would be left behind.

Think full-size axe.What camp is complete without its fire?Our intrepid little companion learned much about setting up camp!We were winning so much that we found a free, unopened beer in a geocache.The camp is set!Miriam cooking up the evening's dose of awesome.The view from campWhat's camping without foraging?&amp;nbsp; These are wintergreen that have been in too much sun.And the wintergreen berries we had for dessert!Partridge berry!&amp;nbsp; Ok, it's not that exciting.&amp;nbsp; I'd only eat these tasteless things if starving.Our daughter, working intently on harvesting wintergreen berries.Overnight, it dropped below freezing, so we had a frosty morning, indeed.Warming up by the fire and drawing with a charred stick because why not?We had such a great time!Now that was the wonderful camp.&amp;nbsp; Here is the tale of the road.We knew there was a long dirt road in, which is nothing new.&amp;nbsp; When entering a state forest you expect as much.&amp;nbsp; However, the road was marked &quot;minimal maintenance&quot;, so we knew it would be potentially exciting.Undaunted, we proceeded as planned, of course.This was the better part of the road.The recent snow melt had rendered much of the road a pile of mud that my boots sank into several inches just walking on it.&amp;nbsp; Rocks tall enough to high-center a Subaru stuck out every now and then, and every now and then, there was a tree trunk to move aside, drive over or drive around.The road in was quite the white-knuckle effort in our 2-wheel drive SUV that Miriam made it through with some rather impressive driving.&amp;nbsp; It was so bad that we figured we would try to find another way out of the forest the next day.&amp;nbsp; Therein lies the tale.We set out before eating lunch, figuring we could take care of that on the road.&amp;nbsp; The weather was lovely, and the sun was warming the frosty landscape.&amp;nbsp; Brynhilde, our Jeep, grumbled along the bumpy dirt roads as we set our course using, alas, Google Maps Navigator.Google Maps apparently hadn't been informed that after Hurricane Irene, an essential bit of road that it suggested we take was closed to all motor vehicles because the Forest Rangers considered it unsafe even for off-road four wheelers and Jeep Wranglers.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, the road was also not marked as such on the end that we were coming from.&amp;nbsp; It just looked rarely-used and a bit rough when we started.&amp;nbsp; It didn't look that way after a while.The road was so narrow that some pickups would not have been able to squeeze down it, so turning around didn't seem possible once the going got rough.&amp;nbsp; The rocks became some large and the ditches so deep that we were scraping over them by force of momentum to avoid being high-centered.&amp;nbsp; Miriam worked the low gears and timed things just right to push that 3000+ pound 2-wheel drive SUV over wet rocks, mud and creeks on a steep incline, the wheels scrabbling for puchase.&amp;nbsp; We kept going because we appeared to have no other option, and we hoped that the road would improve soon.&amp;nbsp; It didn't.Eventually, we got to yet another deep ravine and stopped.&amp;nbsp; Walking ahead, I saw that the next ravine ahead, which had a lovely stream that turned into a waterfall rolling through it, was clearly too deep for Brynhilde to manage, even with Miriam's expert handling.&amp;nbsp; We couldn't back down the hill without losing our rear end.&amp;nbsp; We were stuck.Now, the first thing we did was take stock of our situation.&amp;nbsp; We were stuck in a state forest with a full complement of camping gear, running water nearby and plenty of day light.&amp;nbsp; That's not too bad.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, we had no cell phone signal, we figured we'd be lucky if the car has no damage at this point, and the only dwelling we'd passed in miles was abandoned.We decided to follow the road on foot up the hill to get cell signal and figure out how to rescue our car.&amp;nbsp; That told us a few things.&amp;nbsp; First, there is no way we could have driven up the rest of the hill even if we could fill in that trough with rocks to drive over simply because the mud was too deep and filled with rocks on too steep a slope.&amp;nbsp; It also told us that we had made it within a half mile of a well-maintained gravel road with good cell signal.&amp;nbsp; But now, who do we call?It turns out that if you call the NY State Forest Rangers, they will save you if you are stranded, but they will only save you.&amp;nbsp; The car would be left behind.

On top of the garbage issue, we realized that most of the things we threw away require us to go buy more in short order. &amp;nbsp;Waste and dependency--the plague of modern times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;We can't claim to have solved all the problems yet, but we have made some excellent progress to share with you, our gentle readers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;This issue was easy. &amp;nbsp;Disposable cleaning products, such as paper towels, are rarely actually necessary so long as you have children growing out of clothes, worn out t-shirts, towels and so forth. &amp;nbsp;We started keeping a bag hanging on the wall full of cut-up old clothes that we wash and reuse as needed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Napkins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cloth napkins have proven to not only be a fine and economical way of preventing waste, they are far more useful than paper napkins and paper towels! We use them as pot holders, rags, towels and even a quick &quot;plate&quot; for a baked good when we are afield. &amp;nbsp;Better yet, cloth napkins are less prone to blowing away in a relatively gentle wind like paper ones are. &amp;nbsp;The only &quot;issue&quot; is that you have to wash them when you are done. &amp;nbsp;Since that is the very essence of reusing anything, I don't think that's really a disadvantage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Facial Tissues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brooke has allergies. &amp;nbsp;We used to go through so many facial tissues (and rolls of toilet paper) during the season or when there was too much dust about. &amp;nbsp;Since we've both used cloth handkerchiefs before, this was easily solved in theory. &amp;nbsp;In practice, there is a slight problem. &amp;nbsp;In the modern US, nobody uses them anymore. If not for the Internet, we would have been stuck with either the bulky and oversized bandanas available all over the place or with the dreadfully thin and useless hankies meant to sit, perfectly folded in a man's suit or tuxedo pocket.

On top of the garbage issue, we realized that most of the things we threw away require us to go buy more in short order. &amp;nbsp;Waste and dependency--the plague of modern times. &amp;nbsp;We can't claim to have solved all the problems yet, but we have made some excellent progress to share with you, our gentle readers.CleaningThis issue was easy. &amp;nbsp;Disposable cleaning products, such as paper towels, are rarely actually necessary so long as you have children growing out of clothes, worn out t-shirts, towels and so forth. &amp;nbsp;We started keeping a bag hanging on the wall full of cut-up old clothes that we wash and reuse as needed.NapkinsCloth napkins have proven to not only be a fine and economical way of preventing waste, they are far more useful than paper napkins and paper towels! We use them as pot holders, rags, towels and even a quick &quot;plate&quot; for a baked good when we are afield. &amp;nbsp;Better yet, cloth napkins are less prone to blowing away in a relatively gentle wind like paper ones are. &amp;nbsp;The only &quot;issue&quot; is that you have to wash them when you are done. &amp;nbsp;Since that is the very essence of reusing anything, I don't think that's really a disadvantage.Facial TissuesBrooke has allergies. &amp;nbsp;We used to go through so many facial tissues (and rolls of toilet paper) during the season or when there was too much dust about. &amp;nbsp;Since we've both used cloth handkerchiefs before, this was easily solved in theory. &amp;nbsp;In practice, there is a slight problem. &amp;nbsp;In the modern US, nobody uses them anymore. If not for the Internet, we would have been stuck with either the bulky and oversized bandanas available all over the place or with the dreadfully thin and useless hankies meant to sit, perfectly folded in a man's suit or tuxedo pocket. Thankfully, you can still find quality hankies from Italian manufacturers (or for a lot more money, Irish companies) online, so a good sale on Amazon was all we needed to stock up well. &amp;nbsp;I'm sure we get the occasional silent disapproval for snotting all over a piece of cloth that goes back in a pocket, but that's just fine by us. &amp;nbsp;Since we used to use toilet tissue for blowing noses, cutting out the practice has reduced toilet paper use by more than a third. &amp;nbsp;Plus, some hot water, Dr. Bronner's soap, baking soda and a little Fels Naptha shaved in, and they are good as new, ready for more snots!Why not just burn it?If we burned off paper trash, we'd have to go buy more paper trash later. &amp;nbsp;This just doesn't seem sensible. &amp;nbsp;But what about...There are reasons we still use some disposables. &amp;nbsp;In some cases, we haven't yet found (or implemented) a reusable alternative yet. &amp;nbsp;In others, we just aren't willing to go there just now (Google the term &quot;family cloth&quot; as an example of what we aren't quite willing to do just yet). &amp;nbsp;Overall, we find it useful to have a roll of paper towels for some purposes, but it goes very slowly (currently we have it down to 3-4 weeks to use one roll).
